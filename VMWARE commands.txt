the vmkernel of an esx/esxi host experience a crtical error.
PSOD contains the memory state at the time of crash that includes
Esxi verison, Error type uptime and Core dump locations.

Resoruce pool
logical abstraction of cpu and memory rresoruces
use resource pool to share , limit and reservation of resource for vms
Provides better allocating of cpu and memory resources by using resroces pool 
DRS must be enabled on cluster before creating resource pool.

#LOGS
hostd.log >> incuding VM and host task  and events communication with the vsphere client
and vcenter vpax agent and sdk connections
 
 #HA
 vSphere HA is a new host agent called the Fault Domain Manager, or FDM. T
 his agent is responsible for monitoring host availability and the power state of protected VMs, with the mission 
 of restarting protected VMs when a host or VM fails.

 The master host  sends periodic  heartbeats to the slave host so that the slave hosts know
 that master host is alive

#FAiled SLave host
when a slave host does not respond to the network heartbeat issued by the master host 
the master vsphere HA agent tries to identify cause.

#Failed Master host
when the master host is placed in maintainence mode or crashes the slave hosts 
detect that the master is no longer issuing heaters

Manager Object ID >> MOID based comes to know either master and slave

#Isolated host
if the host does not observe election traffic on the managment and cannot
ping its default gateway, the host isolated 

#VM Storage Failure
VM n/w failure 
Array misconfiguration
Power outrage
Vm availability is affected host are managed 
Application with attached crash.
