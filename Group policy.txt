2)    Check if the DC can reachable – if it’s testing from a user pc or server check if it’s can reach the DC properly.
3)    Check the network connectivity and DNS – check if the network connection is okay and also dns settings are correct. If it’s between different subnets make sure dc can reach the target users or computers.
