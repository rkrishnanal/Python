Windows Server hardening involves identifying and remediating security vulnerabilities.
Organizational Security: Maintain an inventory record for each server that clearly documents 
its baseline configuration and records each change to the server.
Windows Server Preparation:Protect newly installed machines from hostile network traffic until the operating system is installed and hardened. 
Harden each new server in a DMZ network that is not open to the internet.
Windows Server Installation:Ensure that all appropriate patches, 
hotfixes and service packs are applied promptly. Security patches resolve known vulnerabilities that attackers 
could otherwise exploit to compromise a system. After you install Windows Server, 
immediately update it with the latest patches via WSUS or SCCM.
