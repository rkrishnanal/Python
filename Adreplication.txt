DNS TROUBLESHOOTING
update ptr records

check the zone properites
Make  SOA referesh interval at 1 min

clear dns cache
flush and register dns
ipconfig /flushdns
ipconfig /registerdns

Active Directory Integrated Zones
In AD Integrated DNS zone, each server replicates the data with other DNS servers in a domain.
Active Directory Integrated Zones stores its zone data in Active Directory. 
Integrated zones can be replicated to all domain controllers in the domain and forest. 
Active Directory integrated zones use multi-master replication, 
this means any domain controller running the DNS server service can write updates to the zone for which they are authoritative.

Advantages of Active Directory integrated Zones

    Replication is faster, more secure and efficient.
    Better redundancy due to zone data being copied to all Domain Controllers
    Improved Security if secure dynamic update is enabled
    No need to schedule or manage zone transfers

Non-authoritative name servers do not contain original source files of domain’s zone. 
They have a cache file for the domains that is constructed from all the DNS lookups done previously. 
If a DNS server responded for a DNS query which doesn’t have original file is known as a Non-authoritative answer.

An authoritatIn AD Integrated DNS zone, each server replicates the data with other DNS servers in a domain.ive name server is a name server that has the original source files of a domain zone files. 
The is where the domain administrator has configured the DNS records for a domain. 
Authoritative DNS server can be master DNS server or its slaves.

FSMO 
RID:the domain controller assigned to allocated sequence of relative ids to each dc into domain
PDC: Handles time sync and password replication
infrastructure master: updating references from object in its domain to an objects from another domain.
Domain naming master : addition an dremoval of domains in the forest.
Schema master : DC controllers all updated and modifications to the schema.
